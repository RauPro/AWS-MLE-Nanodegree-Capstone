# Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN

This project aims to build a Brain Tumor detection model using a Convolutional Neural Network using the Brain MRI Images Dataset.
<br>
### Dataset 
The dataset that will be used in this project is [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). This dataset will be obtained from Kaggle. The dataset encompasses two folders named "yes" and "no." These folders collectively contain 253 brain MRI images. The images are grayscale and come in different sizes, i.e., they have distinct widths, heights, and the number of channels. The folder "yes" consists of 155 tumorous brain MRI images, and the folder "no" consists of 98 non-tumorous brain MRI images.
